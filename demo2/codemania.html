							<p>Karl (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/avon">@avon</a>) is a Java and Objective-C developer. He began as a BASIC developer and is suspicious that everyone should start writing code with line numbers. GOTO 10 forever. Karl is the co-founder of Auckland web studio Cactuslab, where most websites are based on a super Java content management platform. Karl is also the developer of world famous iOS application Camera+, and famous in some circles web debugging proxy application Charles.</p>
							<h4 class="h3">Lessons from Mobile</h4>
							<p>Mobile has been around for a while, but now it's all about the post-App Store world. For 40 minutes, while balancing the proverbial bowl of fruit on his head, Karl will recount his dark-days as an enthusiastic J2ME developer, and then compare (and contrast) his current outlook: dropping anecdotes like nachos; exploring what has changed in the last 4 years and the lessons we take away to improve all our software development practice.</p>

This is as much a disappointment to him as he's sure it is to you!</p><p>A fan of Bob Dylan, red wine and cycle touring, he lives in a house with sea views with his lovely wife and two children. He's old enough to remember building websites with nested layout tables 6 levels deep.</p>
							<h4 class="h3">We're alone, we're screwed and you have to live your life over and over and over again. Like, for eternity.</h4>
							<p>What implications do the size of the universe, climate change, the global financial crisis and Nietzsche have for the way we live our 
							lives and do our jobs?</p>
							<p>Mike explores this very question! He argues that for those working in the web and IT industries, 
							with the greater power we're gaining over HOW THINGS WORK, comes a greater responsibility to NOT BE AN ASSHOLE.</p>

							<h4 class="h3">How to Not Write a For Loop</h4>
							<p>Simple, reliable and concise: thanks to languages like F# and Scala, and features like LINQ and lambdas, object-oriented programmers are increasingly able to take advantage of functional programming techniques and tools.  But to get the most out of functional programming you need to change your mindset, to think in terms of functional idioms rather than just translating your imperative code into a new syntax.  Learn some of the most important basic idioms, and see how they make your code smaller, safer and simpler!</p>

						<div class="speaker-item-expand">
							<p>Aaron Morton (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AaronMorton">@aaronmorton</a>) has always been interested in databases starting with BTrieve on Novell in the 90's. After many years spent working with RDBMS such as SQL Server, MySql and Oracle he gave them up for the scale and reliability of the Apache Cassandra project in early 2010. Finally deciding to leave a position at Weta Digital in 2011 to spend more time working on the Open Source project and helping others get the best out of the platform. Aaron was voted a Committer to the Apache Cassandra project in 2012.</p>
							<h4 class="h3">Cassandra Does What?</h4>
							<p>Apache Cassandra is a scalable, distributed, fault tolerant cluster database used by sites such as Twitter, Netflix and Urban Airship. This session will cover how data is distributed, fault tolerance, eventual consistency, read repair, hinted handoff, anti-entrophy, distributed deletes, column oriented data model and the read and write paths. By the end you'll have a god idea about how Cassandra is different to a traditional RDBMS and why it can make your life easier.</p>

Despite the language changes, one thing has remained constant - his love of programming and sharing that love with the world.</p>
							<h4 class="h3">Node.js - is that it?</h4>
							<p>Node.js ships with a wide range of features in its standard lib, but what if your company requires

							<h4 class="h3">Modern Perl</h4>
							<p>Like all good modern languages, Perl is evolving: Good Perl today looks nothing like what good Perl looked like even 5 years ago. This session uncovers some interesting modern additions to the language and shows them off to solve some hard problems.</p>

								<h3>Richard Easther</h3>
								<p class="title"></p>
							</a>
						</div>
						<div class="speaker-item-expand">
							<p>Richard (<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/reasther">@reasther</a>) recently returned to New Zealand after 17 years working in Japan and the United States. He is now a Professor and Head of Department of Physics at the University of Auckland.  His research focusses on the properties of very early universe, exploring the origin of our universe and the fundamental forces of nature.  Some of his work involves traditional traditional "pencil and paper" calculations, but much of it involves numerical and data-analysis problems that are tackled with High Performance Computing resources.</p>
							<h4 class="h3">Shocking Tales of (un)Scientific Computing</h4>
							<p>Every year, hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on high performance computing worldwide, but many of the scientists who do the computing have surprisingly little (a technical way of saying "none") formal training in computer science and IT.   Is it that scientists are so smart that they don't need to RTFM, or could they could learn a thing or two from professional coders? Richard will outline the current state of High Performance Computing (in New Zealand and elsewhere) and then tell you what you know, but that a lot of scientists don't.</p>

		 		<p class="fancy carter">We've got the best Luchadores from every fighting style.</p>
			<p>It's a killer speaker line-up: Don't miss this opportunity &mdash; you may not get another chance to hear some of them speak in New Zealand again.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>At Codemania we don't care if you use curly braces or whitespace.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>At Codemania we don't care if you use HTML or XAML.</strong></p>
				<p><strong>At Codemania we don't care if you use Rails or Sinatra.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Great developers learn new languages all the time. You need to focus less on the flavour of technology and more on the awesome.</p>
			<p>Developers have to know what's happening outside their own world. Some of the best talks you can hear are deep, technical talks about platforms that you don't use and maybe will never use.</p>
			<p>That's why we invited some of the world's leading technologists from within their fields to come and talk to <em>you</em></p>
			<p>We think that Codemania has the potential to be something special in the NZ developer community calendar &mdash; you simply need to be there.</p>
